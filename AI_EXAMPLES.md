## 🎯 **Pro Tips**

### **Reference Files in Context**
Use `@filename` to give the AI context about specific files:
```
"@welcome.html change this to use flexbox instead of tables"
```

The more specific you are, the better results:
```
✅ "Create a responsive contact form with validation in contact.html"
❌ "Make a form"
```

```
"Create a calculator app and explain how the JavaScript works"
```
