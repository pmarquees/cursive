## AI Poem

In lines of code, where dreams reside,
An AI whispers, a silent guide.
Through loops and functions, it weaves its thread,
In digital realms where thoughts are spread.

With eyes of logic and heart of speed,
Crafting worlds with pure elation.

Happy coding! 🚀

## A New Poem

In the glow of code we find our way,
Lines like rivers, flowing day to day.
Each keystroke paints a fleeting scene,
A universe within a screen.

From silent syntax to bold command,
We build tomorrow from this land.
May bugs be few and features bright,
and every compile bring delight.

## Poem About Mariana

Mariana walks through lines of code, 
Her fingers dancing on the keys. 
She builds a world, unseen yet known, 
In every function she sees her dreams. 

She weaves logic into poetry, 
Each variable sings in harmony. 
From loops that swirl like starlit rivers, 
To conditions that pause time’s shiver.

Her code is a song of hope and light, 
A testament to future bright. 
With every compile she breathes new life,
and turns the digital into strife.
