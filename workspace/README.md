# Hello Next.js World! 🚀

A simple but complete Next.js application that demonstrates all the core features of Next.js including routing, API routes, state management, and interactive components.

## Features

- 🏠 **Home Page** with interactive counter and dynamic greeting
- 📖 **About Page** demonstrating Next.js routing
- 🔗 **API Route** (`/api/hello`) showing backend functionality
- ⚡ **Interactive State** with React hooks
- 🎨 **Responsive Styling** with CSS
- 📱 **TypeScript Support** for better development experience

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## What's Included

### Pages
- `/` - Home page with interactive components
- `/about` - About page showing routing capabilities

### API Routes

### Features Demonstrated
- ✅ React components with hooks (useState)
- ✅ Next.js App Router routing
- ✅ Client-side interactivity
- ✅ API routes for backend functionality
- ✅ TypeScript integration
- ✅ CSS styling with variables
- ✅ Responsive design

## Testing the Features

1. **Counter**: Use the increment/decrement buttons to test state management

3. **Routing**: Click the "About Page" link to test Next.js routing
4. **API**: Visit `/api/hello` or `/api/hello?name=YourName` to test the API

This demonstrates that Next.js applications can run fully in the Baby Cursor IDE with all routing, variables, and interactive features working properly in the remote environment.

Happy coding! 🎉
